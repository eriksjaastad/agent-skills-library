# Spec-Driven Developer Playbook
## What This Skill Does
This skill enforces a workflow where specifications and automated tests are developed before any code is written. It ensures alignment with project requirements from the outset.

## The Process
1. **Define Requirements**: Clearly articulate what needs to be built, often using acceptance criteria or user stories.
2. **Create Specifications**: Translate requirements into detailed specs, possibly using tools like Gherkin for BDD.
3. **Develop Tests**: Write automated tests that validate the functionality based on the specs.
4. **Implement Code**: After passing all tests, write the actual code to meet the specifications.
5. **Review and Refine**: Iterate as needed to ensure all requirements are met and tests pass.

## Best Practices
- Use BDD tools like Cucumber or Gauge for creating specifications.
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines to automate testing processes.
- Regularly review and update specs alongside changing project requirements.
