# Skill: Niche Scarcity Engineering (The "Oven-less" Approach)

## 🎯 Goal
Build high-authority, visually stunning niche platforms in domains where the physical production assets (e.g., an oven, a 3D studio, a factory) are unavailable, by leveraging AI-driven logic and strict style governance.

## 🛠 Context
Traditional content creation requires the "Asset Moat" (owning the gear). We bypass this by creating a "Logic Moat" (owning the prompt and the schema).

## 📋 The Engineering Workflow

### 1. Mathematical Constraint Scaling
Define a rigid mathematical constraint that acts as the "Authority."
- *Example:* Every recipe must fit exactly in a standard 12-cup muffin tin.
- *Authority:* The user trusts the recipe because it was "Mathematically Scaled," not just "Cooked."

### 2. Editorial Style Governance
Create a "Style Moat" that simulates a professional production environment.
- *The Guide:* High-key lighting, 85mm macro lens, white marble.
- *The Result:* Every AI-generated asset looks like it came from the same high-end physical studio.

### 3. Logic-First Scaffolding
Deploy the platform and SEO schema *before* producing the assets.
- Build the "Brain" (System Prompt) and the "Face" (Editorial UI) first.
- Treat content generation as a "Harvest" phase rather than a "Creation" phase.

## ✅ Impact
- Decouples production speed from physical limitations.
- Enables "Professional-Grade" output from a "Clean Slate" start.
- Differentiates the product through extreme technical consistency (The "Gold Standard").
