# Debugging Routine Playbook

> **Placeholder - Replace with actual debugging process**

## Purpose
This playbook will contain a systematic approach to debugging issues.

## What Should Go Here

### 1. Systematic Approach
- How to start debugging
- What to check first
- How to narrow down the problem
- When to ask for help

### 2. Decision Tree
- Is it reproducible? → [actions]
- Is it in production? → [actions]
- Is it a regression? → [actions]
- Is it environment-specific? → [actions]

### 3. Common Bug Categories
- Null pointer issues
- Race conditions
- Configuration errors
- Data corruption
- Performance problems

### 4. Debugging Tools
- Console/logging
- Debugger usage
- Network inspection
- Database queries
- Performance profiling

### 5. Documentation
- How to document bug findings
- What information to capture
- How to write reproduction steps

## To Fill This In

1. Think about your debugging process
2. What do you always do first?
3. What questions do you ask yourself?
4. Write that down here

## Structure to Create

```
debugging-routine/
├── README.md          ← Full process (this file)
└── decision-tree.md   ← Decision logic
```
