# Skill: The Agent Recommendation Loop

## 🎯 Goal
Enable AI agents to transition from "Passive Executors" to "Active Advisors" by providing a mechanism for them to suggest improvements to governance, style, and structure.

## 🛠 Context
Standard agents only do what they are told. In high-velocity ecosystems, agents are the first to notice when a Style Guide is failing or a Schema is outdated. This skill allows them to flag these insights for the Conductor.

## 📋 The Protocol

### 1. The "Sent Back" Loop
If an **Art Director** agent reviews an image and finds it fails the style guide 3 times in a row, it must not just fail—it must **recommend a change** to the `IMAGE_STYLE_GUIDE.md`.

### 2. Structured Suggestions
Agents should submit recommendations through the **Admin Utility** or a dedicated `REVIEWS/` folder in the project.
- **The Observation:** "I noticed the 85mm macro lens prompt is creating too much blur on mini-lasagnas."
- **The Fix:** "Recommend adjusting aperture to f/4.0 for savory dense textures."

### 3. Personality Infusion
For community-facing roles (like comment responders), the agent must adopt a specific "Human-Enhanced" persona.
- **Rule:** Never be dry. 
- **Rule:** Acknowledge AI nature, but lead with humor.

## ✅ Impact
- Style guides become "living documents" that evolve with the AI models.
- The Conductor acts as an **Editor-in-Chief** rather than a micro-manager.
- Trust is built with users through transparent but entertaining AI interactions.
